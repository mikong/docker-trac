This is to host a bundle to create a docker container running Trac 

Steps to use
------
* Install docker

* Use your own deployment key, this is for your project git repo, you can use `ssh-keygen -t rsa -f deploy_key` to generate one

* Edit 'git clone ...' in entrypoint.sh using your own project source repo
* Edit value of repository\_dir with your own project location in 'trac.ini'

	`docker build -t NAME/TAG .`
